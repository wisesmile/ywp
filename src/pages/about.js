      In 1982, I began a formal practice of meditation. This opened the door
      into a study of Vedanta Philosophy, Yoga and wellness. I taught my first
      Hatha Yoga class in 1985.

      In 1986 I moved to Washington DC and attended classes at yoga centers
      throughout town. I participated at{" "}

        The Self Revelation Church of Absolute Monism
      </a>{" "}
      and immersed myself deeper into study and practice. The weekly services
      and programs focused on Advaita Vedanta, Kriya Yoga and Universality of
      Soul. I volunteered, worked on the grounds and was a member of the Bell
      Choir.

      I returned to Jersey in 2015 and discovered many studios close to home. I
      completed my Yoga Teacher Training 200-hour certification in 2017. I
      immediately began teaching in several local studios.

      My teaching and practice interests are varied; I have a focus on beginning
      students and those with special needs. I am inspired by the writings of
      Swami Kamalandanda, Swami Satchidananda, BKS Iyengar, and Pema Chodron.
