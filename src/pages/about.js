      I was introduced to the practice of meditation in 1982. This practice was
      the gateway to a lifelong study of Vedanta Philosophy and asana practice.
      I taught my first class in 1985.

      In 1986 I moved to Washington DC and enrolled in classes at various yoga
      centers throughout town. I began attending weekly services at The Self
      Revelation Church of Absolute Monism in Bethesda Maryland and accelerated
      my studies. Weekly services highlight Advaita Vedanta, the practice of
      Kriya Yoga and the Universality of Soul. The teachings, lessons,
      instruction, and counsel remain steadfast and have an active presence in
      my life.

      In 2015, I returned to New Jersey and deepened my commitment to the
      practices and study. I’ve met many beautiful souls and teachers that
      inspire my practice. In 2017 in completed my Yoga Teacher Training
      200-hour certification and immediately began teaching.

      My interests are varied; I enjoy teaching beginning students, individuals
      with special needs and those striving for the sublime spiritual connection
      of asana, breath, and mediation. I remain inspired by the writings of
      Swami Premananda, Srimati Kamala (Swami Kamalandanda), Swami
      Satchidananda, BKS Iyengar, and Pema Chodron. I’m the proud father of two
      amazing children and wake up grateful. I work as a software engineer and
      have a love of the arts, playing and enjoying music.
